Lab-07:

Focus of this lab was to take the information we got and placed in the <code>ul</code> and <code>li</code> during Lab-06 and change it into a <code>table</code> format.
We have to use a Constructor to hold the data for the "stores" that we will create using the <code>new</code> element.

Reflections and Comments:
- Struggling on getting the total value of each day for all stores, just can't seem to figure it out.
- Took a while to get the table down, starting to understand i better. 
- Pretty much fully understand the Objects, Arrays, and Constructors.
